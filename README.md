# Neural-Architecture-Search
Final project for CSC-424. We are using Keras to generate neural networks that are trained in a supervised fashion on data sets. We will develop a method to explore the space of hyperparameters defining both the network architecture and training procedure to improve performance.

got a setup on bryan's gpu rig in the physics lab
installed pip, created a venv to hold keras, tensorflow
source venv
pip install keras , tensorflow-gpu
clone github repo
